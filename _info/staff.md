## Course instructor: Phill Conrad

* Email: Please use Campuswire rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Campuswire to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (phtcon@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). 

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.

# CS 16 Staff Profiles

## Phill Conrad, Instructor

Phill Conrad is a Teaching Professor in the CS department at UC Santa
Barbara.  Prof. Conrad joined the CS department in 2007, after
previously teaching at both Temple University in Philadelphia, and the
University of Delaware, where he earned his Ph.D.  His current
research is in the area of Software Engineering Education, and focuses
on bridging the gap between academic coursework, and real-world
software engineering practices.

## Nawel Alioua, TA

Hi everyone! My name is Nawel, and I am a first year Ph.D. student in the CS department at UCSB. I graduated with an Engineering/Master's degree from the National School of Computer Science in my hometown of Algiers - Algeria. I then moved to Japan to pursue my second Master's at the University of Tokyo, before joining Hitachi, Ltd. as a researcher.  During the 5 years I spent in the corporate world, I had the chance to work on very different projects, ranging from networking protocol development, to renewable energy systems design. That's our privilege as computer scientists: wherever there is some sort of computation/data involved (which in this day and age is everywhere!), we can have a role to play, and a contribution to make. For my Ph.D. I am planning to focus on networking technologies, as I believe efficient and reliable communication is the lifeline of modern societies. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about any of the above themes, and of course, about C++ development. I'm excited to be part of the CS 16 staff, and I look forward to working with you all!

## Satyam Awasthi, TA

Satyam Awasthi is an MS student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. He completed his UG studies from IIT Kharagpur, India in 2020 and joined Samsung at SRI-N thereafter. As a software engineer at SRI-N, he broadly worked on Android app development. His current area of interest is web and app development along with computer networking.

## Kevin Heffernan, TA

Bio coming soon.


## Lucas Relic, TA

Hi! My name is Lucas (he/him/his) and I am a 5th year BS/MS student studying computer science. I took this course 4 years ago and I know how daunting learning a new language (or programming for the first time) can seem. However, my goal is to break down difficult concepts and get everyone comfortable with C++ and C++ development. Future classes will build upon these fundamental topics so it's important to get a good grip on them now, and I can't reiterate enough how important it is to ask for help! Supportive teaching staff really enabled me to succeed in CS 16 and I hope to provide the same experience to all of you.

My research interest lies where computer vision and machine learning meet, as well as other deep learning applications. Additionally, my undergrad degree here was in Computer Engineering, and I've taken a wide variety of CS and ECE courses. Stop by my office hours if you'd like to ask any questions about my research, classes, or anything UCSB in general! I've been around campus for a while, so I might have some good information for you.

In my free time, I like to ski, ride bikes, and play video games. I look forward to getting to know all of you!

## April Sanchez, TA

April (she/her/hers) is a B.S/M.S student in the CS Department at UC Santa Barbara. April graduated with her B.S in CS in June 2021 and is currently completing her M.S. This is her first quarter as a TA in the CS Department but she has had prior experience as a ULA for courses such as CS8, CS16, CS32, CS40, CS64, and CS100. As an Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) student, April did HCI research in UCSB's Four Eyes Lab, but her current research interests are in Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. April has also intered at Google as a Software Engineering Intern for the past three summers. In her free time, April enjoys baking and going to the gym.


## Ashley Wang, TA

Hey everyone! My name is Ashley (she/her/hers) and I'm currently a 5th year in the BS/MS program. I'm super excited to be TA-ing for this class and to help you get a better understanding of any fundamental C++ topics. I also did my undergrad here at UCSB, so if you have any questions about specific classes or my undergrad experience in general, feel free to reach out or swing by office hours. If you ever have any questions, the best way to contact me will be through Campuswire through DM, and I'll try to get back to you within 24 hours. I'm really looking forward to meeting y'all and getting to know you throughout the rest of the quarter!


## Shu Yang, TA

Shu (she/her/hers) is a M.S student in the CS Department at UC Santa Barbara. As an Research Intern student, Shu did machine learning and system research in UCSB Lab with Yufei Ding. This is the first quarter as a TA in CS Department, but she had prior experience as a grader for courses like CS24, CS64, CS154 and CS111. Shu has also intered at Facebook as a Production Engineering Intern in Summer2021. In her free time, she enjoys cooking and watching anime.

## Arthur Gatin, LA


 Hello dear students! My name is Arthur, and I will be your ULA this quarter. CS16 was the first course I took at UCSB three years ago, so I'm nostalgic and also exteremely sympathetic towards you who get to experience this course and learn the basics of C++ for the first time. I will do my best to make sure you have a good experience in this class. Feel free to come for any help or chat about anything that interests you.



## Connor McIntosh, LA

Connor McIntosh is an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for CS16 
and a 4th year CS major from Ventura, CA. He is a member of the 
Data Science club at UCSB who has worked on and started sports analytics 
machine learning projects. Connor is also a member of the Gaucho Pep Band, 
so you may see him playing the drums at basketball and soccer games this year.


## Jerry Wang, LA


Hello, I am a senior CS student. My study interests are artificial intelligent and algorithm design.
My office hour: TR 3:20pm - 4:20pm
I'll hold my office hours outside chem 1179, together with professor Conrad under the tree. We can always move to Phelps Hall 3525 if needed.
