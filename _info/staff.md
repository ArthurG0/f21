* Email: Please use Campuswire rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Campuswire to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (phtcon@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). 

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.

## Lucas Relic, TA

Hi! My name is Lucas (he/him/his) and I am a 5th year BS/MS student studying computer science. I took this course 4 years ago and I know how daunting learning a new language (or programming for the first time) can seem. However, my goal is to break down difficult concepts and get everyone comfortable with C++ and C++ development. Future classes will build upon these fundamental topics so it's important to get a good grip on them now, and I can't reiterate enough how important it is to ask for help! Supportive teaching staff really enabled me to succeed in CS 16 and I hope to provide the same experience to all of you.

My research interest lies where computer vision and machine learning meet, as well as other deep learning applications. Additionally, my undergrad degree here was in Computer Engineering, and I've taken a wide variety of CS and ECE courses. Stop by my office hours if you'd like to ask any questions about my research, classes, or anything UCSB in general! I've been around campus for a while, so I might have some good information for you.

In my free time, I like to ski, ride bikes, and play video games. I look forward to getting to know all of you!

## April Sanchez, TA

April (she/her/hers) is a B.S/M.S student in the CS Department at UC Santa Barbara. April graduated with her B.S in CS in June 2021 and is currently completing her M.S.
