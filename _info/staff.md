## Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA)
In addition to the intructor and TA, there are several ULAs in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). Note that we are switching all in-person closed and open labs to online office hours (see below)


## Online office hours via zoom starting March 11 (Wed)

Following the Chancellor's email on March 10, all in person office hours and labs are canceled. Instead, we are offering online office hours with the course staff and the professor from today (March 11) until Monday (March 16). Please follow the instructions below to join the online office hours. You will need access to a laptop with a micro-phone. We highly recommend using headphones and avoid noisy places. You have the option of turning on your camera to provide a video feed, although that is completely optional.
