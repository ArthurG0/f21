# Introduction

This page will have instructions for your first discussion section.  It will be updated soon.

For now: please know this:
* You should participate during your assigned discussion section time.  
* You are encouraged to come in person if you can, but you may also participate over Zoom if you are unable to do so (e.g. due to quarantine, Covid symptoms, or other issues).  A zoom link will be provided at the appropriate time (if one is not, just use the lecture zoom link.)

# Why you need to come to your assigned discussion section

With such a large number of students, we need to be sure that there is an appropriate number of staff deployed to help you.  If everyone just comes to "whatever discussion section suits their schedule", we'll have problems.

If you have a standing conflict with your section, please use the "Section swap request" discussion on Campuswire.com to find someone to switch with.
