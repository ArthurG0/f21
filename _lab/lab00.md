# Which Computer Should I Use

* If you have your own laptop, that's fine: just use that for today.
* If you don't, there are 21 desktop computers you can use, but for those, you need a College of Engineering Account.
  * Set up your account here: <https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create>

# Introduction

This page will have instructions for your first discussion section.  It will be updated soon.

For now: please know this:
* You should participate during your assigned discussion section time.  
* You are encouraged to come in person if you can, but you may also participate over Zoom if you are unable to do so (e.g. due to quarantine, Covid symptoms, or other issues).  A zoom link will be provided at the appropriate time (if one is not, just use the lecture zoom link.)

# Why you need to come to your assigned discussion section

With such a large number of students, we need to be sure that there is an appropriate number of staff deployed to help you.  If everyone just comes to "whatever discussion section suits their schedule", we'll have problems.

If you have a standing conflict with your section, please use the "Section swap request" discussion on Campuswire.com to find someone to switch with.

# Instructions for TAs

* Please look over the roster for your section on Gauchospace, and see if each student is in the zyBook.
* If they are not in the zyBook at all, please email them, and cc me and remind them that they need to sign up.
* If they are in the zyBook, but in the wrong section (and/or any other information is incorrect, e.g. perm or school email), please email them, cc me, and ask them to fix it.

Help students with whatever problems they are having working on the labs.
