# Step by Step Instructions

## Step 1: Getting Ready

1. Go to github and find a repo for this lab assigned to your GitHub id.
2. Log on to your CSIL account.
3. Change into your `~/cs16` directory
4. Clone your empty lab06 repo into your `~/cs16` directory.
5. In your empty repo, do `git checkout -b main` to establish that you are on the `main` branch as your default branch.


## Step 2: Obtain the starter code

The starter code is in this repo:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f21/STARTER-lab09>

The URL for cloning this repo is this: `git@github.com:ucsb-cs16-f21/STARTER-lab09.git`

Previous labs contain instruction for the process of:
* Adding a `starter` remote for this repo
* Pulling the code from that `starter` remote into your own repo.

Please do those steps now, and then do a `git push origin main` to populate your own repo with the starter code.

If you need help with these steps:
* First consult previous labs for more detailed instructions.   
* Then, if you are still having trouble, ask the staff for help during discussion section or office hours.

Once you've populated your repo, typing the `ls` command should show you the following files in your current directory

```
$ ls
Makefile              linkedListFuncs.h	       tddFuncs.cpp
README.md             llTests.cpp		           tddFuncs.h
linkedList.h          moreLinkedListFuncs.cpp
linkedListFuncs.cpp	  moreLinkedListFuncs.h
```
